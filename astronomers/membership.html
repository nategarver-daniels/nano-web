  <meta name="description" content="NANOGrav is a collaboration of astronomers, physicists, and engineers from over a dozen universities, colleges, and observatories across North America. We include faculty, scientific staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and high school students.  Our goal is to directly detect gravitational waves --- tiny ripples in space-time --- and use them to study the Universe by measuring their effect on radio wave signals traveling to the Earth from pulsars --- rapidly rotating neutron stars. Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz --- hence the NANO in our name, NANOGrav. The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another. Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.">

    <h2>Collaborate with NANOGrav</h2>
    <p>
    Gravitational wave detection with pulsar timing touches on a
    number of areas of astrophysics, and we're interested in
    discussion and collaboration with scientists in relevant fields,
    e.g. galaxy and black hole co-evolution, electromagnetic searches
    for binary supermassive black holes, gravitational wave source
    prediction, alternative theories of gravity, etc. We readily
    welcome talks on these and other relevant topics in our monthly
    NANOGrav science telecon, and/or discussion on these topics at our
    regular Gravitational Waves Astrophysics working group meetings to
    foster collaboration with NANOGrav science topics. Please contact
    <a href="mailto:sarahbspolaor@gmail.com">Sarah Burke-Spolaor</a>
    if you would like to present your work in either of these forums.
    </p>
    <h2>Membership Policy</h2>
    <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
    <p>
    The goal of this policy is to define membership to encourage an
    environment in which the members of NANOGrav can work together
    productively, efficiently, and with collegiality. All members are
    expected to make a meaningful contribution to the Collaboration
    and are encouraged to publish NANOGrav results as expediently as
    possible. Meaningful contributions that warrant membership

      <li>Carrying out timing analyses of NANOGrav data for
	gravitational-wave related work</li>
      <li>Data management</li>
      <li>Development of cyber-infrastructure for NANOGrav</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Levels of Membership</h3>
    <p>
    Five levels of membership exist for individuals fulfilling the
    above requirements:
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Junior Members</dt>
      <dd>are undergraduate students who contribute to NANOGrav by
      carrying out relevant research with an Associate or Full Member
      and have been accepted as members according to the process
      described below.</dd>
      <dt>Associate Members</dt>
      <dd>are graduate students, post-docs or senior
      researchers/faculty members who have been accepted as members
      within the past 12 months, or who have not been promoted to Full
      Membership status.</dd>
      <dt>Full Members</dt>
      <dd>are graduate students, post-docs or senior
      researchers/faculty members who have completed at least 12
      months in the Collaboration and have had their membership status
      reviewed by the process described below. Within this category
      are Senior Personnel who are Full Members with permanent
      positions, or in positions that they sustain through research
      funding. They have additional service and voting
      responsibilities as defined below and in the by-laws.</dd>
      <dt>Legacy Members</dt>
      <dd>are former Full Members who are no longer active (e.g. have
      moved out of the field, or joined a different collaboration) but
      have a lasting contribution to the Collaboration either through
      partial ongoing work or recent development (e.g. of software
      which they are still being consulted about).</dd>
      <dt>Institutional Members</dt>
      <dd>are organizations with which NANOGrav has executed a
      Memorandum of Understanding. The rights and responsibilities of
      Institutional Members are defined exclusively by their MoU with
      NANOGrav.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>3. Membership Process</h3>
    <p>
    Membership in NANOGrav is open to any researcher who is willing to
    contribute to NANOGrav's goals of detecting and studying
    gravitational waves via pulsar timing. New membership requests
    should be submitted to the NANOGrav Chair in writing and should
    include a concise (maximum of one page) description of the
    contribution the potential member intends to make. In the case of
    undergraduate students, the request should be co-authored by their
    proposed mentor. Potential new members are encouraged to contact
    any Full Member of NANOGrav for help in writing the request. New
    membership requests shall be accepted by the Collaboration
    continually throughout the year. Each request shall be reviewed by
    the Full Membership and discussed at the next NANOGrav
    meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
    Unless any Full Member voices an objection, the membership
    application shall be accepted, and the person applying may become
    either a Junior or Associate Member as defined
    above.<sup><a href="#memfoot">1</a></sup> In the case of one or
    more objections, the membership application shall be subject to a
    vote among all Full Members and accepted in the case of a majority
    vote. Upon acceptance, incoming non-undergraduate members automatically gain the status of Associate Membership for a period of one year. After this time, an Associate member may request Full Membership by emailing the NANOGrav Chair with a statement describing their accomplishments as an Associate Member, along with their goals and expected contributions to NANOGrav in the coming year. The Senior Personnel shall then review the case and can approve it with a supermajority vote. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Each year, by June 30, all existing members must post a statement
    on the NANOGrav wiki clearly describing their accomplishments in
    the past 12 months along with their goals, expected contributions
    to, and requested status within NANOGrav in the coming year. A
    group assigned by the NANOGrav Management Team shall review the
    statements every year. The review process shall respect any leave
    of absence (e.g. family or medical reasons) when evaluating
    contributions. The Management Team shall make decisions to
    allow:
    </p>
    <ul>     
      <li>A Full or Associate Member to continue their current status</li>
      <li>A Full or Associate Member to continue their current status
	but with a warning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In the case of an Associate Member requesting an upgrade to Full
    Membership, the Senior Personnel shall review the case and can
    approve it with a supermajority vote. Conversion to Legacy
    Membership is normally a voluntary transition, but, if upon review
    of the statements, the Management Team deems that conversion is
    warranted, the member shall be encouraged to step down within the
    next year. In rare cases, the Senior Personnel, by supermajority,
    may vote a person into Legacy membership.
    </p>
    <p>
    Organizations wishing to become Institutional Members negotiate
    their MoU with the Management Team, which shall consult with the
    Full Members during the negotiations. The final MoU shall be
    presented to the Full Members for ratification. The MoU will
    become active following ratification. Ratification of
    Institutional Member MoUs requires a supermajority of the Full
    Members voting. Institutional Member MoUs shall be reviewed
    yearly, or on another schedule as specified in the executed
    MoU. Institutional Membership may be terminated upon agreement of
    both parties, at the yearly review by a supermajority vote of all
    Full Members, or at any other time upon recommendation of the
    Management Team and a supermajority vote of all Full Members
    voting.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Expectations</h3>
    <p>
    NANOGrav members are expected to participate, be collegial, and
    abide by the Collaboration’s decisions and by-laws. A breach of
    these expectations may be grounds for expulsion. NANOGrav members
    must also adhere to the Astronomical Society Ethics Statement. A
    breach of these professional ethics is grounds for
    expulsion. Expulsion requires a supermajority vote among all
    Senior Personnel.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <div class="row" id="harassment">
    <h2>NANOGrav Anti-Harassment Policy</h2>
    <p>The NANOGrav collaboration does not tolerate harassment of any form between its members and is committed to ensuring an environment free from all forms of discrimination,harassment, and retaliation. NANOGrav is committed to providing an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of scientific ideas. All functions of NANOGrav must be conducted in a professional atmosphere in which all participants are treated with courtesy and respect. It is the responsibility of the NANOGrav MT, of the organizers of any NANOGrav meeting, and of the members themselves to ensure that such an atmosphere is maintained. Harassment, sexual or otherwise, is a form of misconduct that undermines the integrity of all NANOGrav activities. Violators of this policy will be subject to discipline.</p>

   <h3>1. Definition of Sexual Harassment</h3>
     <p>Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Behavior and language that are welcome/acceptable to one person many be unwelcome/offensive to another. Consequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.</p>

   <p>Sexual harassment does not refer to occasional compliments of a socially acceptable nature. It refers to behavior that is not welcome, is personally offensive, debilitates morale, and therefore, interferes with work effectiveness. The following are examples of behavior that, when unwelcome, may constitute sexual harassment: sexual flirtations, advances, or propositions; verbal comments, including repeated comments on personal appearance, or physical actions of a sexual nature; sexually degrading words used to describe an individual; a display of sexually suggestive objects or pictures; sexually explicit jokes; unnecessary touching.</p>

   <p>Even in cases where an individual victim cannot be identified, lewd, offensive, or inappropriate behavior may be construed as harassment and cannot be tolerated in a professional, collegial environment.</p>

  <h3>2. Definition of Other Harassment</h3>

  <p>Harassment on the basis of any other protected characteristic is also strictly prohibited. This conduct includes, but is not limited to: epithets, slurs or negative stereotyping; threatening, intimidating or hostile acts; denigrating jokes and display or circulation of written or graphic material that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual or group.</p>

  <h3>3. Scope of Policy </h3>

  <p>This policy applies to all attendees at NANOGrav activities, including scientists, students, guests, staff, contractors, and exhibitors, participating in the scientific sessions, tours, and social events of any NANOGrav meeting or other activity.</p>

  <h3>4. Reporting of Incidents and NANOGrav Member Advocates</h3>

  <p>Advice for reporting sexual or other forms of harassment is available on the web site of the Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy (CSWA): <a href="http://www.aas.org/cswa/">www.aas.org/cswa/</a>. Below is a summary of the more detailed information available on the CSWA web page:</p>

  <p>Write everything down (times, places, nature of the incident, and comments made). Save e-mails, notes, etc. Tell someone you trust. It is likely that you will have to write and sign an official letter of complaint, documenting the nature of the harassment and/or discrimination. Be as detailed as possible. Supporting documentation and statements from witnesses should be submitted with your letter.</p>

  <p>Two NANOGrav Member Advocates will be appointed by the Management Team to serve for two-year terms. The appointments will be staggered in time by one year so there is a one year overlap between a current Member Advocate and a newly appointed one.</p>

  <p>Any individual covered by this policy who believes that he or she may have been the subject of harassment should contact one of the two designated NANOGrav Member Advocates or any member of the MT, hereafter referred to as the contact person. He or she is not required or expected to discuss the concern with the alleged offender. If the contact person and the individual making the report decide than an investigation should be pursued, then the report will be investigated. All reports will be treated confidentially, seriously, and, if deemed appropriated, be investigated promptly. </p>

  <h3>5. The Investigation</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li> The contact person will, in consultation with at least one other member of the MT, name an impartial investigator, typically one of the Member Advocates or a senior member. Any named investigator who believes they have a conflict of interest should not serve as an investigator.</li>
    <li> In most cases, the complainant will be interviewed first and the written complaint reviewed. If the complainant has not already filed a formal complaint, he or she should be asked to do so.</li>
    <li> The investigator will verify claims and collect all relevant data</li>
    <li> The details of the complaint should be explained to the alleged offender by the investigator.</li>
    <li> The alleged offender should be given a reasonable chance to respond to the evidence of the complainant and to bring his or her own evidence.</li>
    <li> If the facts are in dispute, further investigatory steps may include interviewing those named as witnesses.</li>
    <li> If, for any reason, the investigator is in doubt about whether or how to continue, he or she will seek appropriate counsel.</li>
    <li> When the investigation is complete, the investigator should report the findings to the contact person.</li>
  </ol>
<h3>6. Retaliation is Prohibited </h3>

  <p>NANOGrav will not tolerate any form of retaliation against persons who file a complaint or assist in the investigation. Retaliation is a serious violation of this policy and, like harassment or discrimination itself, will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>

<h3>7. Disciplinary Action </h3>

<p>Individuals engaging in behavior prohibited by this policy as well as those making allegations of harassment in bad faith will be subject to disciplinary action. Such actions range from a verbal warning to ejection from the collaboration and the reporting of their behavior to their employer.</p>

<h3>8. Appeal & Questions</h3>

<p>In the event that the individual is dissatisfied with the results of the investigation, he or she may appeal to the MT. Any questions regarding this policy should be directed to the NANOGrav Member Advocates</p>
