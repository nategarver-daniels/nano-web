  <meta name="description" content="NANOGrav is a collaboration of astronomers, physicists, and engineers from over a dozen universities, colleges, and observatories across North America. We include faculty, scientific staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and high school students.  Our goal is to directly detect gravitational waves --- tiny ripples in space-time --- and use them to study the Universe by measuring their effect on radio wave signals traveling to the Earth from pulsars --- rapidly rotating neutron stars. Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz --- hence the NANO in our name, NANOGrav. The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another. Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.">

    <h2>Membership Policy</h2>
    <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
    <p>
    The goal of this policy is to define membership to encourage an
    environment in which the members of NANOGrav can work together
    productively, efficiently, and with collegiality. All members are
    expected to make a meaningful contribution to the Collaboration
    and are encouraged to publish NANOGrav results as expediently as
    possible. Meaningful contributions that warrant membership
    include, but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Development of data acquisition systems to provide
	high-quality data</li>
      <li>Analyzing astrophysical implications of NANOGrav results</li>
      <li>Searching for new millisecond pulsars to add to the array
	and improve sensitivity</li>
      <li>Development of new data analysis techniques that shall
	directly benefit NANOGrav</li>
      <li>Development of tools and algorithms for optimizing NANOGrav
	observations</li>
      <li>Studies of ancillary astrophysical work within NANOGrav</li>
      <li>Management work within NANOGrav</li>
      <li>Mentoring a student or postdoctoral research associate in
	NANOGrav projects</li>
      <li>Financial support for personnel, hardware or telescope
	access time</li>
      <li>Carrying out observations for NANOGrav</li>
      <li>Carrying out timing analyses of NANOGrav data for
	gravitational-wave related work</li>
      <li>Data management</li>
      <li>Development of cyber-infrastructure for NANOGrav</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Levels of Membership</h3>
    <p>
    Five levels of membership exist for individuals fulfilling the
    above requirements:
    </p>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>Junior Members</dt>
      <dd>are undergraduate students who contribute to NANOGrav by
      carrying out relevant research with an Associate or Full Member
      and have been accepted as members according to the process
      described below.</dd>
      <dt>Associate Members</dt>
      <dd>are graduate students, post-docs or senior
      researchers/faculty members who have been accepted as members
      within the past 12 months, or who have not been promoted to Full
      Membership status.</dd>
      <dt>Full Members</dt>
      <dd>are graduate students, post-docs or senior
      researchers/faculty members who have completed at least 12
      months in the Collaboration and have had their membership status
      reviewed by the process described below. Within this category
      are Senior Personnel who are Full Members with permanent
      positions, or in positions that they sustain through research
      funding. They have additional service and voting
      responsibilities as defined below and in the by-laws.</dd>
      <dt>Legacy Members</dt>
      <dd>are former Full Members who are no longer active (e.g. have
      moved out of the field, or joined a different collaboration) but
      have a lasting contribution to the Collaboration either through
      partial ongoing work or recent development (e.g. of software
      which they are still being consulted about).</dd>
      <dt>Institutional Members</dt>
      <dd>are organizations with which NANOGrav has executed a
      Memorandum of Understanding. The rights and responsibilities of
      Institutional Members are defined exclusively by their MoU with
      NANOGrav.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>3. Membership Process</h3>
    <p>
    Membership in NANOGrav is open to any researcher who is willing to
    contribute to NANOGrav's goals of detecting and studying
    gravitational waves via pulsar timing. New membership requests
    should be submitted to the NANOGrav Chair in writing and should
    include a concise (maximum of one page) description of the
    contribution the potential member intends to make. In the case of
    undergraduate students, the request should be co-authored by their
    proposed mentor. Potential new members are encouraged to contact
    any Full Member of NANOGrav for help in writing the request. New
    membership requests shall be accepted by the Collaboration
    continually throughout the year. Each request shall be reviewed by
    the Full Membership and discussed at the next NANOGrav
    meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
    Unless any Full Member voices an objection, the membership
    application shall be accepted, and the person applying may become
    either a Junior or Associate Member as defined
    above.<sup><a href="#memfoot">1</a></sup> In the case of one or
    more objections, the membership application shall be subject to a
    vote among all Full Members and accepted in the case of a majority
    vote. Upon acceptance, incoming non-undergraduate members
    automatically gain the status of Associate Membership for a period
    of one year, at which point their membership status is reviewed
    for conversion to Full Membership as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
    Each year, by June 30, all existing members must post a statement
    on the NANOGrav wiki clearly describing their accomplishments in
    the past 12 months along with their goals, expected contributions
    to, and requested status within NANOGrav in the coming year. A
    group assigned by the NANOGrav Management Team shall review the
    statements every year. The review process shall respect any leave
    of absence (e.g. family or medical reasons) when evaluating
    contributions. The Management Team shall make decisions to
    allow:
    </p>
    <ul>     
      <li>A Full or Associate Member to continue their current status</li>
      <li>A Full or Associate Member to continue their current status
	but with a warning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In the case of an Associate Member requesting an upgrade to Full
    Membership, the Senior Personnel shall review the case and can
    approve it with a supermajority vote. Conversion to Legacy
    Membership is normally a voluntary transition, but, if upon review
    of the statements, the Management Team deems that conversion is
    warranted, the member shall be encouraged to step down within the
    next year. In rare cases, the Senior Personnel, by supermajority,
    may vote a person into Legacy membership.
    </p>
    <p>
    Organizations wishing to become Institutional Members negotiate
    their MoU with the Management Team, which shall consult with the
    Full Members during the negotiations. The final MoU shall be
    presented to the Full Members for ratification. The MoU will
    become active following ratification. Ratification of
    Institutional Member MoUs requires a supermajority of the Full
    Members voting. Institutional Member MoUs shall be reviewed
    yearly, or on another schedule as specified in the executed
    MoU. Institutional Membership may be terminated upon agreement of
    both parties, at the yearly review by a supermajority vote of all
    Full Members, or at any other time upon recommendation of the
    Management Team and a supermajority vote of all Full Members
    voting.
    </p>
    <h3>4. Expectations</h3>
    <p>
    NANOGrav members are expected to participate, be collegial, and
    abide by the Collaboration’s decisions and by-laws. A breach of
    these expectations may be grounds for expulsion. NANOGrav members
    must also adhere to the Astronomical Society Ethics Statement. A
    breach of these professional ethics is grounds for
    expulsion. Expulsion requires a supermajority vote among all
    Senior Personnel.
