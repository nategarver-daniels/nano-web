We include faculty, scientific staff, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, and undergraduate students, and high school students.  Our goal is to directly detect gravitational waves --- tiny ripples in space-time --- and use them to study the Universe by measuring their effect on radio wave signals traveling to the Earth from pulsars --- rapidly rotating neutron stars. Our measurements are most sensitive to gravitational waves with periods of a few years, which corresponds to frequencies of a few nanohertz --- hence the NANO in our name, NANOGrav. The strongest sources of such gravitational waves are likely to be binary systems in which two massive black holes orbit one another. Such binary systems form when galaxies merge with one another.">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    NANOGrav stands for North American Nanohertz Observatory for
    Gravitational Waves.  As the name implies, NANOGrav members are
    drawn from across the United States and Canada and our goal is to
    study the Universe using gravitational waves.  Gravitational waves
    are ripples in the fabric of space and time that cause objects to
    shrink and stretch by very, very small amounts.  NANOGrav uses the
    Galaxy itself to detect gravitational waves with the help of
    objects called pulsars &mdash; exotic, dead stars that send out
    pulses of radio waves with extraordinary regularity.  This is
    known as a Pulsar Timing Array, or PTA.  NANOGrav scientists make
    use of some of the world's best telescopes and most advanced
    technology, drawing on physics, computer science, signal
    processing, and electrical engineering.  Our short term goal is to
    detect gravitational waves within the next decade, an event which
    may be the first direct detection ever.  But detection is only the
    first step towards studying our Universe in a completely new and
    revolutionary way, and we are sure to make unexpected discoveries
    in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
    NANOGrav cooperates with similar experiments in Australia (the
    Parkes Pulsar Timing Array) and Europe (the European Pulsar Timing
    Array).  Together, we make up the International Pulsar Timing
    Array, or IPTA.  By sharing our resources and knowledge, we hope
    to usher in the era of gravitational wave astronomy more quickly
    and with greater impact.
    </p>
    <p>
    NANOGrav was founded in October 2007 and has since grown to over
    60 members at over a dozen institutions.  NANOGrav members have
    been awarded over $10M in competitive scientific grants
    and awards to perform NANOGrav-related research at their institutions.

      This figure illustrates the range of gravitational wave astronomy. 
      Gravitational waves (GWs) span many orders of magnitude 
      in frequency, from the Hubble-length primordial 
      waves that leave their imprint on the cosmic microwave 
      background (CMB), to the gravitational waves with periods 
      of years detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) like 
      NANOGrav, the hour-long period waves
      detectable by space-based instruments such as eLISA, 
      and the millisecond period waves detectable by ground-based 
      interferometers like LIGO and Virgo. Each of these experiments 
      probes different time-scales and hence a wide range of objects 
      and phenomena in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>  
      We show the range of amplitudes (measured by the gravitational wave strain h) and frequencies.  
      The four essential techniques are shown, at the approximate locations for the 
      amplitudes and frequencies that they probe.  For each technique also shown is 
      the expected kinds of sources that should produce gravitational waves at this 
      range of amplitudes and frequencies.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of NANOGrav and other PTAs in this enterprise is the detection 
      of very low frequency (VLF) gravitational waves associated with 
      supermassive black binary black holes (SMBBHs), whose observations 
      can be used to probe the innermost regions of merging galaxies and 
      perhaps reveal the presence of other exotic phenomena.
